What is Rest API

Set of operation where developers can perform a request and receive response via http protocol


Rest API Architecture
-----------------------
Iphone App	<--JSON/XML-->	Rest API(Process Businees Logic)  <---https://->   App Server
(Platform independen)

1. For ex, for a weather app, enter zip code. It is passed through xml or json
2. Rest API applies business logic and sends to App server (weather.com server) gets the data and transfer back to Iphone APP

3. Sometime we may not have access to hit their API
4. The App server itself gives the API. We can use their API to get the data


5. For example, Google exposes API to apps like UBER to use the locations



6. What is the endpoint?

Endpoint consisit of : baseURL/resource?parameters			//resource and paramters can be separatd by ?

Ex: qaclickacademy.com/courses-detail/id=wev

BaseURL: basic web urls : qaclickacademy.com
Resource: exact tab in the url : courses-detail
Paremeters: paremters/data can either be passed in xml or directly in the endpoint

Sample endpoint geenrated when searched something on google
Ex: https://www.google.com/search?q=qaclickacademy&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS862US862&oq=qaclickace&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2j5.3830j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

here, google.com is baseuRL
      search is resource
      q=value is the parameter


7. What are types of rest requests?
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

GET - To retrieve details from server. It cannot be modified
Paramters needs to be sent as part of request URL

POST - Adding/Creating something new. Not for retreiving data from server
Parameters should be in xml/json. It should not be sent in request URL

Request : Body/Payload

coursename:
description:
trainer details:

PUT - Same as POST, but only difference here we are replacing something but not creating new

DELETE - For delete something from server

Request : Body/Payload

coursename:
description:
trainer details:




8. What is Header/cookies

Sometimes you need to autheniticate yourself to talk to the server

For ex, for qaclickacademy

Need a key, value to be passed as header along with request to the server
Server will authenticate the key,value sent along with the request


Also, other than authenticate . the other type of header is content-type
Content-type is like in what format the server has to respond

for ex, content-type = json
this is passed in the header

Key is content-type
Value is JSON



Another Ex,

In JIRA - Session ID is generated when logged in

To create a Bug, need to use POST request

POST baseURL/defect - But JIRA will reject it because Rest API is stateless and need to send the Header each time to authenticate


So when using POST need to send the Header with session ID along with endpoint

POST baseURL/defect
Header
SessionID=kadkjndjasn



REST represents with URI - baseURL/resource?params



9. Understanding google place searching API for scripting

1. Go to google, search = google place search api and click on first link

2. URI = https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/output?parameters
	baseURL = https://maps.googleapis.com
	Resource = maps/api/place/findplacefromtext
	output = output may be in JSON or XML format, should be mentioned here
	?paremters = It is the params


Sample URI

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json?input=Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%20Australia&inputtype=textquery&fields=photos,formatted_address,name,rating,opening_hours,geometry&key=YOUR_API_KEY

baseURL = https://maps.googleapis.com
Resource = maps/api/place/findplacefromtext
Output = JSON
Params = ?input=Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%20Australia&inputtype=textquery&fields=photos,formatted_address,name,rating,opening_hours,geometry
key = key=YOUR_API_KEY

Key is important to be passed as header to authenticate yourself to google server and use their features
